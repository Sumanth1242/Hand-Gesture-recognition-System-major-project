# Hand-Gesture-recognition-System-major-project
### Gestures are a form of nonverbal communication in which visible bodily actions are used to communicate important messages, either in place of speech or together and in parallel with spoken words. In a world with multiple modes and languages used for communication, itâ€™s a tedious task to be what everyone calls a global citizen. Hand gestures is a medium through which information can be conveyed irrespective of your origin, mother-tongue and best of all, disability.

### The aim of this project is to develop an interactive interface that captures an image of a hand gesture and correctly predicts and displays the letter that the hand gesture represents. This tool can help ameliorate the problems faced by the Individuals with speaking and hearing disabilities, family members who constantly need to communicate with individuals with the disabilities as listed above, teachers present in institutions that cater to the needs of the differently abled and doctors and nurses who attempt to understand the ailments of the differently abled individuals. The images captured from the web camera are initially transformed, following this, the features based on which the model is trained are extracted, and an accurate prediction of the hand gesture is made and the same is displayed. In this system, feature detection and feature extraction of hand gesture is done with the help of CNN and openCV.
